# law_encoding

`law_encoding` is a Rust library designed to provide efficient and easy-to-use A-law and μ-law (mu-law) audio encoding and decoding functionalities. These encoding schemes are widely used in digital audio processing, particularly in telephony and audio compression, according to ITU-T standards G.711.

## Features

- **A-law Encoding/Decoding**: Compress and expand audio data using the A-law algorithm.
- **μ-law Encoding/Decoding**: Compress and expand audio data using the μ-law algorithm.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for minimal overhead and maximum throughput.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into audio processing pipelines.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can download Rust and find installation instructions at [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

Add `law_encoding` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
law_encoding = "0.1.0"
```

### Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started with `law_encoding`:

```rust
use law_encoding::{LawEncoder, InputFormat, OutputFormat};

fn main() {
    let audio_data: Vec<u8> = vec![/* Your raw audio data here */];
    let mut encoded_data = vec![0u8; audio_data.len()]; // Buffer for encoded data

    let encoder = LawEncoder::new();
    let num_bytes_encoded = encoder.encode(
        InputFormat::LinearPCM,
        &audio_data,
        OutputFormat::ALaw,
        &mut encoded_data,
    ).expect("Failed to encode audio");

    println!("Encoded {} bytes of audio data.", num_bytes_encoded);
    // You can now use `encoded_data` as needed
}
```
