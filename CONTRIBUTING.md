# Contributing

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use GitHub Flow

All code changes happen through pull requests, so we recommend GitHub's [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.**
2. **If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.**
3. **Ensure the test suite passes.**
4. **Make sure your code lints.**
5. **Issue that pull request!**

## Any contributions you make will be under the Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [license](LICENSE).
